This file serves as my program for the U6-A1 Adventure Game

History:
Jan 12, 2023: Program Creation
Jan 16, 2023: Created functions for each location
Jan 18, 2023: Connected all the locations together as required by my adventure game plan
Jan 22, 2023: Added all neccesary dialogue
Jan 24, 2023: Finished mini games and submitted program
Feb 16, 2023: Broke up dialogue into smaller sections for easier processing by using the input() function, and made code accomodating for both uppercase and lowercase input
